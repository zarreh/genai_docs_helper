## Project Details

### Time Series Analysis Toolkit

#### Overview
Our time series analysis toolkit includes a variety of methods and models designed to handle different aspects of time series data. These include traditional statistical methods, machine learning models, and deep learning techniques.

#### Methods and Models
1. **Exponential Smoothing**: A classic method for forecasting time series data, including single, double, and triple exponential smoothing.
2. **Prophet**: A powerful tool developed by Facebook for forecasting time series data, capable of handling multiple seasonal patterns and special events.
3. **CATS**: A comprehensive library that includes Prophet and other models, designed for fast and accurate time series analysis.

### Forecasting Techniques

#### Exponential Smoothing
Exponential smoothing is a foundational technique in time series forecasting. It involves smoothing past observations to predict future values. The method can be extended to handle trends and seasonality.

#### Prophet
Prophet is designed to handle complex time series data with multiple seasonal patterns and special events. It uses a generalized additive model to fit the data and provides robust forecasts.

#### CATS
CATS (Comprehensive Algorithm for Time Series) is a versatile library that includes various models for time series analysis. It offers tools for forecasting, anomaly detection, and change point detection.

### Anomaly Detection

#### Overview
Anomaly detection is crucial for identifying unusual patterns in time series data. This can help in detecting fraud, system failures, or other significant events.

#### Techniques
1. **Z-Score Method**: A simple yet effective method for detecting anomalies based on standard deviations from the mean.
2. **Change Point Detection**: Identifying points in the time series where the statistical properties change significantly.

### Change Point Detection

#### Overview
Change point detection helps in identifying shifts in the underlying process generating the time series data. This is useful for understanding regime changes or structural breaks.

#### Techniques
1. **Biocpd**: A method included in the CATS library for detecting change points in time series data.
