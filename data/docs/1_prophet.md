### Time Series Forecasting with Facebook Prophet

#### Overview

This document details the process and results of a time series forecasting project using Facebook Prophet. The goal was to build a robust, interpretable model for predicting future values based on historical time series data. The workflow includes data preparation, exploratory analysis, model training, forecasting, and evaluation.

---

#### Project Objectives

- Develop a time series forecasting model using Facebook Prophet.
- Visualize and interpret the forecast and its components.
- Evaluate model performance and identify areas for improvement.

---

#### Data Preparation

The dataset was loaded and preprocessed to fit Prophet’s requirements. The key steps included:

- **Loading Data:** The time series data was imported, ensuring the date column was in the correct datetime format.
- **Renaming Columns:** Prophet requires columns to be named `ds` (datestamp) and `y` (value to forecast).
- **Handling Missing Values:** Any missing or anomalous data points were addressed to ensure model stability.

---

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

Initial visualizations were created to understand the data’s structure and trends:

- **Time Series Plot:** The historical data was plotted to observe overall trends, seasonality, and outliers.
- **Summary Statistics:** Basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) were computed to understand the data distribution.

---

#### Model Development

**Prophet Model Setup:**

- The Prophet model was instantiated with default parameters, with the option to tune for seasonality and holidays if needed.
- The model was trained on the historical data.

**Forecast Generation:**

- A future dataframe was created, extending the timeline for the desired forecast horizon.
- The model generated forecasts for these future dates, including uncertainty intervals.

---

#### Results & Visualization

- **Forecast Plot:** The forecasted values were plotted alongside the historical data, providing a clear visual of predicted trends.
- **Component Plots:** Prophet’s built-in component plots were used to visualize trend, weekly, and yearly seasonality effects.
- **Model Evaluation:** Where possible, actuals were compared to forecasts to assess accuracy.

---

#### Key Findings

- The Prophet model captured the main trend and seasonality in the data.
- Forecast intervals provided a measure of uncertainty, useful for risk assessment.
- Component analysis revealed the relative importance of trend and seasonal effects.

---

#### Challenges & Next Steps

- **Data Quality:** Some noise and missing values required careful preprocessing.
- **Model Tuning:** Further improvements could be made by tuning seasonalities, adding holiday effects, or incorporating external regressors.
- **Evaluation:** Additional backtesting and error analysis are recommended for production deployment.

#### Example Code Snippet

from prophet import Prophet
import pandas as pd

# Load and prepare data
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
df.rename(columns={'date': 'ds', 'value': 'y'}, inplace=True)

# Fit model
model = Prophet()
model.fit(df)

# Create future dataframe and forecast
future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=30)
forecast = model.predict(future)

# Plot results
model.plot(forecast)
model.plot_components(forecast)
