This class of processes is defined through linear relationship between observation and noise factors.\n\nJust to indulge my inner nerd, I will go top-down in this one and start from a high level definition - because why not :-) A linear process is a time series $X_t$ defined by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    X_t = \\sum_{u = -\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_u \\epsilon_{t-u}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_t$ is a white noise series and \n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{u = -\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left|\\psi_u \\right|^2 < \\infty\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nTranslated to plain English:\n* (in our context) white noise a serially uncorrelated sequence of random variables with zero mean and finite variance. For a general definition (and the origin of the color convention) I can recommend the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise\n\n* it is a linear combination - potentially infinite and depending on both past and present - of a white noise series\n\n* in the real world it has to be causal $\\implies$ depending on a finite number of past values\n\n* it is a unified framework for handling different types of data generating processes\n\n* for the mathematically inclided person reading this: huge parts of the theory behind ARMA processes pop up as special cases / corrolaries from results in functional analysis, specifically the [Hilbert projection theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_projection_theorem) and [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem); the requirement on sum of squared values being finite correspond to belonging to an $l_2$ space for our sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space\n\n* only needs second order statistics (variance) $\\rightarrow$ works best for elliptical distributions (e.g. Gaussian)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## AR processes","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The simplest (non-trivial) example of a linear process is an autoregressive process of order $p$:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    X_t = \\sum_{i= 1}^p \\phi_i X_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{equation}\n    \nUnpacking the formula:\n1. Natural extension of a multiple linear regression model: we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable (lagged values act as predictors). The term \\textit{auto}regression reflects the fact that we are regressing the variable on (version of) itself\n2.

Easy to estimate parameters and forecast \n\n\nNow that we have defined (and hopefully understood) what an AR process is, let's have a look at how to identify one. This is relevant if we need to decide whether an autoregressive process is a right kind of model for a particular dataset.
